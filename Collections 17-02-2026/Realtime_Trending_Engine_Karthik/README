Real-Time Trending Products Engine
This project implements a backend system designed for high-traffic e-commerce platforms to detect trending products and categories during peak events like Flash Sales. The system processes a continuous stream of order events and identifies popularity within a sliding 10-minute window

Features
1. Real-Time Top 5 Products
Identifies the top 5 products with the highest order count globally
Maintains accuracy by only considering events from the last 10 minutes
Updates the ranking in real-time as new events arrive

2. Regional Trending Categories
Groups trends by geographical region (e.g., India, US)
Identifies the top 3 trending categories for each specific region

3. Efficiency and Performance
Thread-safe implementation to handle simultaneous events from millions of users
Memory-efficient architecture that automatically removes expired entries
Fast lookup and updates using optimized Java Collections

Technical Design
The engine utilizes a sliding window algorithm to ensure only relevant data is processed:
- Event Storage: Uses a Deque to maintain the insertion order of events, allowing for fast removal of expired data from the front
- Frequency Tracking: Utilizes HashMaps for O(1) key-to-count lookups and updates
- Sliding Window: A background cleanup process removes events older than 10 minutes from the queue and decrements their counts in the frequency maps simultaneously

Data Structure Requirements
- The OrderEvent object consists of the following attributes:
    orderId: Unique identifier for the transaction
    userId: Unique identifier for the customer
    productId: Unique identifier for the product
    category: The product category (e.g., Electronics, Books)
    region: The geographical location of the order
    timestamp: The epoch time when the order was placed

Constraints and Performance Goals
- Insertion: Achieves O(1) time complexity for recording new events.
- Frequency Update: Achieves O(1) time complexity for updating product and category counts.
- Expiration: Efficiently removes data older than 10 minutes to maintain a constant memory footprint.
- Concurrency: Ensures data integrity through thread-safe collections or synchronization.
